Flask Tutorial

The project directory will contain:

flaskr/, a Python package containing your application code and files.

tests/, a directory containing test modules.

.venv/, a Python virtual environment where Flask and other dependencies are installed.

Installation files telling Python how to install your project.

Version control config, such as git. You should make a habit of using some type of version control for all your projects, no matter the size.

Any other project files you might add in the future.
